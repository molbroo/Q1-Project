              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">What do I wear?</h2>
              <h4>Clothing</h4><p>Ignore fashion; wear what’s comfortable. High socks are common on deadliftt day to prevent scraping on your shins, but other than that, it really doesn’t matter. You could do squats in your birthday suit if you want (though I take no responsibility when you get arrested or kicked out of your gym).</p>

              <h4>Shoes</h4><p>The number one piece of “gear” I’ll recommend you get is a good pair of shoes to lift in. Now, good lifting shoes do not need to be expensive! The most important quality of a good lifting shoe is being able to drive through your heels – so a flat sole or solid sole is what you’re looking for. Your classic running shoe will not fit the bill here – it’s extremely hard to press through your heels when you’re standing on something as cushy and soft as a running sneaker. (Note: If you can’t get a better shoe, I would rather you squat in running sneakers than not squat at all.  Squatting barefoot is an excellent alternative if your gym will allow it.) Your classic Converse Chuck Taylor All Star will work very well here, are affordable, and is what many top powerlifters still wear.</p>

              <h4>Gloves</h4><p>Some people like to use gloves to protect their hands from developing callouses while lifting. However, you still get callouses and your hands can rip from under the gloves. Since they can also mess up your grip and technique, I do not recommend wearing them.</p>

              <h4>Knee/Wrist Wraps</h4><p>Not to be confused with straps, the main purpose of wraps are support and stability, though some wear wrist wraps to help with grip as well. Some wraps (mainly used for powerlifting) are so heavy duty that they feel like a cast, and are only worn only for the lift itself.</p>

              <h4>Straps</h4><p>Straps are wrapped around the bar and are used to help you hold on. These allow you to hold on to weight longer, or train without exhausting your grip. Great tool for intermediate and advanced lifters, but nothing to worry about in the beginning.</p>

              <h4>Weightlifting Belt</h4><p>These come in both velcro and leather varieties, and can be very useful for the intermediate and advanced lifter. I did not wear one for the first year of lifting, and even after I started wearing one, it was another few months until I was comfortable that I was using it right.</p>

              <p>If you’re just starting out, don’t worry about having all the right accessories. Get a good pair of shoes and get started!</p>

            <div id="equipment" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Equipment</h2>
              <p>The first time you walk into a gym it’s easy to get overwhelmed. There are so many different things going on and everyone seems to know what they’re doing.</p>

              <p>Most gyms are laid out in the following way:

              <br>Cardio area (has treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, etc)
              <br>Weights area
              <br>Group Fitness Room
              <br>Locker Rooms</p>
              <p>There are a ton of different types of racks, and every gym (or basement/garage) has a different one! Let’s go over the basic equipment you’ll be using to squat and do your major “push” and “pull” exercises.</p>

              <h4>Squat Stands</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "pictures/squatstand.jpg"><p>These are two pieces that stand next to each other to hold up your barbell. These are great for portable workouts, but for inside a gym, they have a lot of disadvantages (they don’t hold as much weight, aren’t as sturdy, and lack safety features).</p>

              <h4>Squat Racks</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "pictures/squatrack.jpg"><p>Squat racks come in many shapes and sizes, but most typically they are two vertical uprights connected with a horizontal pole. Some have safeties built in and some do not. The ones that don’t aren’t much better than the individual squat stands, though they are a little more stable. If you have a choice, a squat rack with adjustable safeties is your best bet.</p>

              <h4>Power Rack</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "pictures/powerrack.jpg"><p>One step above the squat rack is the power rack. These look like big metal rectangles with holes every 2 inches or so up and down each vertical side. Power racks have safety pins across each side and J-hooks to hold the barbell. One of the great things about your gym having a power rack is that it’s versatile – you can use it to bench press, overhead press, squat, and more.</p>

              <h4>Smith Machine</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src  = "https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/smithmachine-e1362430102915.jpg"><p>The smith machine is a type of plate loaded machine that looks a lot like a squat rack, only there are rods that guide the path of the bar. NOTE: While staff at the gym may tell you that they are safer to use, we never recommend using them, as it forces your body into fixed, unnatural positions (not to mention it has been proven that you get better gains out of using free weights).</p>

              <p>“So how do I tell the difference between a smith machine and a squat rack?” Is the bar attached to something without being able to be removed off the machine? It’s a smith machine. That simple</p>

              <h4>Weight Machines</h4><p>There are two main types of these, plate loaded and pin loaded. The pin loaded (or ‘stack machines’) have stacks of rectangular weights with a hole in them for the pin. The lower down you insert the pin, the more weights are lifted. The advantage of these is that you do not need to load weights on and off between sets. With plate loaded machines there are no weights attached to the machine – you must put the weight plates on the machine yourself. Many plate loaded machines offer a higher range of motion than stack loaded machines.</p>

              <h4>Cable Machines</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/axle1-e1362434061305.jpg"><p>These machines come in many different shapes and sizes, but are almost always stack loaded. Cable machines will have a handle attached to the end of a cable, which is then pushed or pulled in various directions depending on the specific exercise. These can be great for assistance exercises to your barbell or dumbbell lifts, as unlike other weight machines, they still allow free range of movement.</p>

              <h4>Pull-up Bar</h4><p>You would be surprised how many gyms do not have a good pullup bar. There are a few places to look if you don’t see a freestanding pullup bar right away: the top of the cable machine, power rack, or smith machine. Some offer multiple grip options without offering a straight bar. The two main grip options that are the most useful are a straight bar and a neutral grip (where your palms are facing each other).</p>

              <h4>Dip Station</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0154/5825/products/yhst-17965644003626_2234_2141166_1024x1024.gif?185"><p>Sometimes dip stations are freestanding, while others are attached to the cable machine or power rack. Adjustable handles are nice for those of us who are smaller and a wider dip station puts our bodies in a bad position.</p>

              <h4>Assisted Pullup/Dip Station</h4><p>This is a stack loaded machine: you select a weight, then stand on a platform that offers a specific amount of help on your pullup or dip. These can be useful if you can’t do a pullup or dip yet, though we recommend the use of bands instead.</p>

              <h4>Bench</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/fullgym1.jpg"><p>There are a few types of benches, standard flat benches and adjustable ones. The adjustable benches allow you to exercise at an incline or decline. These are one of the most commonly used pieces of equipment in the weight room, so it’s always good if there are at least 3 or 4.</p>

              <h4>Bench Press</h4><img class = "equipmentpic" src = "https://www.nerdfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/regbench2-e1362434235494.jpg"><p>Some gyms (especially smaller gyms and CrossFits) just use squat stands or squat racks for the bench press. Most commercial gyms have benches that are specially made for the bench press (with a stand attached). While these are a personal preference, check to see if the rack is adjustable, especially if you are shorter.</p>

            <div id="stretching" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Stretching</h2>
              <p>It is vital that you stretch before and after your sessions.  This is not old school P.E. where you are going to touch your toes and stretch your arms across your chest.</p>
              <p>Before your workout you will want to <b>dynamically</b> stretch.  That means you are not holding a pose-rather you are moving while stretching.  Check out our <a class = "white-text" href = "stretching.html">stretching</a> page for an awesome dynamic stretching routine for before your workout</p>
              <p>After you workout, this is where you are going to want to static stretch and hold your poses.  Check out our <a class = "white-text" href = "stretching.html"> stretching</a> page for a killer static stretch routine for after your workout</p>
            </div>
            <div id="sets-reps" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Sets and Reps Breakdown</h2>
                <p>For your exercises, you'll often see one number x another number (e.g. 3x5).  The first number is how many sets you will perform and the second number is how many repitiions you will do in each set.  For example, for a 3x5, you would perform the movement 5 times without resting, then rest, and perform the same thing 2 more times.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="rest" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Rest Between Sets</h2>
              <p>This is not a cardio workout where you will be pumping out as much stuff as you can with little or no breaks.  You want to make sure to rest in between each set for 60-180 seconds before starting the next set.  During this time pace around, sit down, or go grab a drink of water--it doesn't matter.  Just make sure you are getting adequate rest time before starting again.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="recovery" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Recovery</h2>
              <p>Have you ever heard anyone say that your muscles aren’t built in the gym, but in the kitchen?</p>

              <p>That’s because when you’re in the gym, you’re breaking apart the muscle fibers. When you’re out of the gym, you’re healing (and getting stronger).  So it’s important to take adequate rest days as a part of your strength program.</p>

              <p>The general rule of thumb is to wait 48 hours before working the same muscle group again.</p>

              <p>One thing to remember with this is that our muscles work together – so when you’re working on your “chest” you’re probably also working all of the muscles in your shoulders, along with your upper arms.</p>

              <p>Recovery is different for everyone depending on many different factors such as what the actual workout is, how old you are, your sleep quality, diet, and other recovery elements (such as massage and stretching).</p>

              <p>For a basic strength program, working out 3-4 days a week is plenty.  This is one of those situations where more is not necessarily better.</p>

            <div id="nutrition" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Nutrition</h2>
              <p>To understand how the right foods can help you after exercise, it’s important to understand how your body is affected by physical activity.</p>

              <p>When you’re working out, your muscles use up their glycogen stores for fuel. This results in your muscles being partially depleted of glycogen. Some of the proteins in your muscles also get broken down and damaged.</p>

              <p>After your workout, your body tries to rebuild its glycogen stores and repair and regrow those muscle proteins.</p>

              <p>Eating the right nutrients soon after you exercise can help your body get this done faster. It is particularly important to eat carbs and protein after your workout.</p>

              <p>Doing this helps your body:

              <br>Decrease muscle protein breakdown.
              <br>Increase muscle protein synthesis (growth).
              <br>Restore glycogen stores.
              <br>Enhance recovery.</p>
