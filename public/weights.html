        <div class="row">

            <div id="bodyweight" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Bodyweight First</h2>
                    <p>Before ever trying to figure out how much weight you can lift, make sure you know how to do the movement, as flawless as possible, without any weight at all.</p>
                    <p>Why?</p>
                    <p>Because if you can’t do a movement correctly without weight, how can you expect to do it right WITH weight?  Think about it – if you can’t walk up a flight of stairs normally, would you expect to be able to walk up the flight of stairs carrying bags of groceries?  No – you would only hurt yourself.</p>
                    <p>So our first step is to learn each movement without any bars, dumbbells, or added weight.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="bar" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Now, the Bar</h2>
              <p>Your first workout shouldn’t go any heavier than “just” the bar, which means the bar without any added weight.  As we know from strength training equipment, a standard barbell weighs 45 lbs (20.4 kg).  Now, don’t be discouraged if this seems really heavy – especially on upper body movements.</p>

              <p>If the bar seems too heavy to start, you have a few options:
              <br>1. Look to see if the gym has a lighter barbell – some have a “women’s bar” or a “training bar” that usually weigh 30-35 lbs and 15 lbs, respectively.  These are usually shorter, but that’s okay (just make sure it’s a straight bar. The ez curl bar is not a good alternative).
              <br>2. Start out with dumbbells – while the movement is not the exact same, it allows you to build up the strength to be able to correctly handle the bar.
              <br>3. Focus on bodyweight training until you build the strength to handle the bar.</p>

              <p>Now, on opposite ends of the spectrum, if the bar seems really light, I would STILL encourage you to complete your first workout with just the bar.  Focus on getting each rep correct, and worry about adding weight next time.</p>

              <p><i>Note: If you finish your first workout with the bar and still aren’t comfortable with the movements, it’s never a bad thing to do your next workout with just the bar again.  If you’re not comfortable with the movement and you start adding weight, not only will you be more likely to injure yourself because your body isn’t ready, but you’ll be more likely to hurt yourself because you won’t be confident under the bar. Confidence is something that is very important as you start lifting heavier and heavier.</i></p>

              <p>If you’re planning on using dumbbells as your main lift (and not a barbell), I’d start out with the 5-10 lb dumbbells to get a feel for things.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="startingweight" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">Starting to add Weight</h2>
              <p>After a proper warm up routine, start with the empty bar again, and complete the prescribed number of reps</p>
              <p><i>“But I thought you said we could add weight this time?” you might be thinking.</i></p>

              <p>You can – but no matter how heavy you are going, always start with just the bar to warm up for EACH exercise. This helps get your body warm, primes your nervous systems and all of your muscles for that movement, and gets you ready to lift heavier weight.</p>

              <p>Next, add some weight to the bar.  Depending on how heavy the bar felt, start by adding anywhere from 2.5lbs to 10lbs to each side.  Do another set of 5 reps at this weight.</p>
              <p><i>(Note: If you’re doing dumbbell training, instead of adding weight to the bar, increase the weight of the dumbbell.  Start with 5lb dumbbells, then 10lbs dummbells, for example)</i></p>

              <p>If you were able to complete those reps both without losing form and without the speed of the bar slowing, add more weight to the bar.  Base the amount of new weight off how it felt – if the last set felt really light, add 10’s, if it felt heavy, add 2.5’s or 5’s.</p>
              <p>Continue to do this until your form starts to break down or the speed of the lift gets slower on any of your reps. The weight you used right before your form started to break down is your starting weight on which you will base all future workouts!</p>
              <p>It is better to start out too light than too heavy.  Remember – we’re trying to get solid, productive sets in, not find our max, so we want all of the reps to be fast and with as perfect form as our body allows.</p>

              <p>And since during this process you’re testing out heavier weights for the first time, never be afraid to have a spotter, or to use pins to ensure your safety!</p>
            </div>
            <div id="contweight" class="section scrollspy">
              <h2 class  = "red-text text-darken-4">After the first few workouts</h2>
              <p>Once you find your starting weight, you’ll want to start using something called “progressive overload.”</p>

              <p>Simply put, progressive overload means gradually increasing the stress put on your body during training.</p>

              <p>In other words, we need to increase something, regularly. Usually this means the amount of weight we lift. And for beginners, that can often happen in every workout.  After every workout our body heals, and if you’re getting proper sleep and nutrition, it heals back stronger than it was before.</p>

              <p>So, how much weight do you add when you’re ready to increase your workouts?</p>

              <p>That depends on how difficult was the sets last time. This is where great note-taking comes in (I’m a huge fan of a simple notebook, or Evernote docs on my phone). Be sure to document not only how much you lifted and for how many reps, but also how your lifts went so next time you know what you need to be doing.  Did you go to failure on your last set? Did your form break down on any of the reps?</p>

              <p>If you failed to complete an of your reps or your form started to break down, it might not be a bad idea to do the same weight again, and focus boosting your form and technique of each rep.</p>


              <p>If you were able to get through all of your sets with great form, and without the bar slowing down, consider adding more.  It’s not unheard of for beginners to add 10-20lbs a week to some lifts (especially squats and deadlifts), though don’t get discouraged if you’re only adding 2.5 or 5!</p>

              <p>The BEST THING YOU CAN DO is to slowly add weight and progress consistently rather than progress very quickly then hit a plateau.  Each week, as you add a little bit of weight, you are building strength, confidence, and momentum.</p>

              <p><i>(Note: For some lifts, especially the overhead press or bench press, adding just 5 lbs may be too much to go up per workout.)</i></p>

              <p>Remember that there will be days when you can’t add any weight.  So many things affect how your lifts are going to feel – from a baby crying all night, to lots of stress at the office, to drinking too much at the big game.  It’s important to listen to your body over listening to some number telling you what you should be lifting.</p>
