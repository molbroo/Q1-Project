# Q1-Project

## What does it do?
This website develops a strength training plan for you based on how many days you want to strength train per week.  The user then can learn more information about a particular exercise by clicking on the icon.  This link provides a written description as well as a video how-to.  Additionally, it provides a basics page that lays out what to expect in the gym, defines terminology, and walks you through working out, if you are new.  Also, there is a weights section which give the user information about what weight they should be using for each exercise.  Lastly, it provides a link for stretching videos for before and after your workouts.  
## Workflow
For this project, I really wanted to develop something that would make my life easier.  I often have trouble thinking of a strength training program if I get bored with mine, or if the time I can commit to it lengthens or shortens.  Once, I came up with my concept, I began thinking of all the features I wanted to be present in the site.  Then, I began wireframing to get the general idea of how I wanted to it look.  Next, I developed user stories to make sure I could have a viable product that would target different things that a user would want out of it.  I then began coding, and used HTMl, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Materialize.
